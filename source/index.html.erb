            <span class="story-date">1990s</span>
            <p class="first">I grew up in Ahmedabad, New Jersey, and New York. I didnâ€™t have my own computer until the late 90s, but was always experimenting with new hobbies. Painting, dark room photography, music production, stage lighting, video production. I was privileged enough to attend schools that gave me access to computers and expensive equipment. I even won a couple of awards for my music production and video editing! <br /> <em>(I was pretty good at baseball too, tbh. I played first base and shorstop. One of my fondest memories of playing Little League was hitting an in-the-park grand slam. Nothing earns respect after moving to the United States like getting one in for the team.</em>)</p>
            <span class="story-date">2009</span>
            <p>While at my alma mater, I started a student design agency with some friends to help students get real world client experience they donâ€™t get in school. The agency is still around to this day! I studied Biochemistry for most of my university days, but design had an everlasting pull. It was after an internship at a cancer center when I realized where my heart was calling me to.</p>
            <span class="story-date">2011</span>
            <p>I had a serious knee surgery scheduled for right after graduating from college, which kept me bed ridden for a couple of months. While I was recovering, I started a design studio with my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-m-29574521/" target="_blank">Rahul Mahida</a>. It failed spectacularly, but we both learned quite a lot about starting a business, getting clients, and working with a friend. Later, I landed at what was then <a class="livestream" href="https://www.livestream.com/" target="_blank">Livestream</a> as a Web Designer. I created mini-experiences for clients using Facebookâ€™s app framework, helped design the iOS app, worked on various facets of our hardware (including packaging), and overall contributed to the design of every aspect of our customer experience. I worked with phenomenal people, many of which I consider to be lifelong friends.</p>
            <span class="story-date">2013</span>
            <p>I was lured to <a class="saavn" href="https://www.saavn.com/" target="_blank">Saavn</a> by <a href="" target="_blank">Clint Baclom</a> for what would is still to this day one of the most fulfilling periods of my design career. I got to work on products and features that impacted millions of people. I was also part of a small team that redesigned and launched a brand new Android app, to enormous success.</p>
            <span class="story-date">2014</span>
            <p>Rahul and I were early employees at a small oncology analytics startup called <a class="cota" href="https://www.oncota.com/" target="_blank">COTA</a>. This was our first truly early stage startup experience, and we went through many ups and downs together. I left in mid 2016 and went on sabbatical.</p>
            <span class="story-date">2017</span>
            <p>Iâ€™m currently at <a class="mongodb" href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. Iâ€™ve worked on great products here, helping launch MongoDB Stitch and helping grow the team from a practice of 7 designers to 34 designers and researchers.</p>
