As the product team and I were fleshing out the details of the atomic data model for our platform, and I was designing the Clinic app (read about it [here](/cota-clinic/)), I realized the importance of laying down a foundation for a modular, flexible design system. This was super important in a data heavy product suite such as ours, especially since it would eventually be a living product.

I use Brad Frost’s Atomic Design principles to help me guide through this, although I largely used my own approach.
