At the start of every year, I post my reflections on the previous year. This time however, I reflected on the last decade. And it was wild. 

I have written a much longer year by year reflection (link at the bottom of the post), but below is my tl;dr.

2010-2019:  
🧪👨🏾‍💻 Changed career paths  
🎓 Graduated  
👨🏽‍🦽 Left patellar tendon replacement after a decade of subluxations and dislocations. Bedridden for two months.  
💫 Started a two-man studio with Rahul called “The Design Aura” which didn’t go very far  
🎥 Hustled and got my first job at Livestream  
🗽 Moved to NYC  
🎵 Joined Saavn  
🚗 Car accident  
🏋🏾‍♂️ Lost 80 pounds  
🧬 Joined COTA  
🧠 Started going to therapy, which profoundly changed my life (I still go)  
✈️ Caught the travel bug  
🚲 Caught the biking bug  
❤️ Fell in love  
💳 Joined Behalf for a hot second  
🌱 Joined MongoDB, and so grateful to be a part of an IPO  
👨‍👧‍👦 Became a manager  
💔 Didn’t work out (and that’s ok!)  
🤝 Started helping/advising [Sakhi](https://www.sakhi.org), a non-profit  
✨NEW✨ 🏡 Signed contract to buy a condo (🤞🏾 just need to close)  
🤗 And above all else... met so many of you INCREDIBLE people  

Who knows what the next decade will bring?

One thing is certain. I feel privileged to be a part of all of your lives - and am so grateful you’re a part of mine. The people around us make our lives possible, and make our lives more meaningful. 

This decade, amongst other things - I’ve learned to be more thoughtful, social, and action oriented. Next decade, I will be more patient, intentional, and unrelentingly focused. One pattern I’ve noticed is, with some exceptions, I’ve been largely reactive - with both macro and micro decisions. This year, I will learn and practice being more proactive. 

When you’re taking steps in the moment, you don’t realize how far you’ve come. But each step brings you closer to wherever you are going. What’s important is that you take that step. When you fall down, you get up and take another step. 

Forward, always.
