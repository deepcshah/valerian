<!-- <p>My name is Deep Shah, and I’m a product designer <i>(for lack of a better term)</i>. Currently, I’m building software for developers at <a class="mongodb" href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.</p>
        <p>Previously, I designed software at <a class="behalf" href="https://www.behalf.com/">Behalf</a> that makes it easier for small businesses to get access to the capital that they need to run their businesses. Prior to that, I’ve built a platform to help create better outcomes for cancer patients. Prior to that, I was at <a class="saavn" href="https://www.saavn.com/">Saavn</a>, where I led the design for their Android app. I cut my teeth at <a class="livestream" href="https://www.livestream.com/">Livestream</a>.</p>
        <p>I believe design is a bridge between technology &amp; people. At the end it is about solving a problem — for the people or the business or both, if you are lucky.</p>
        <p>I prefer creating solutions that provide real value to people. My favorite teams are ones where titles are irrelevant, and everyone takes ownership without ego.</p> -->
